# sralloc

Special case memory allocators for C (possibly with C++ wrappers).

Intended to be more or less interchangeable, stackable, and swappable, for use in a hierarchical manner. Also performant and visualizable.

Does NOT contain general purpose heap allocators - replacements for dl/rp/xxxmalloc.
